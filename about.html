        <h1 class="title">About Us</h1>
        <p>
            All of us have been close friends since highschool, each of us dabbling in music here and there. Eventually we decided
            to just record an album for giggles, just to see if we could. But then the unthinkable happened. People like it.
            So, we just kept making more. Over time, we all fully discovered what part of music production we do best.
            Justin does great with rythmn and all things drums. Ipsumus can shred the guitar like we used to shred our less than
            favorable report cards. Dolorem found her affinity for the keyboard, giving our songs a powerful and memorable melody.
            Finally, Lorem found her place as our lead singer, delivering not just the words of our songs, but the pure soul of it.
            We all use our skill and life experience in our music to send a variety of messages, but the most important thing to us
            is that we tell it how it is.
